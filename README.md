Explanation of code and data for Breen Hu 2021

'forecast.R': contains functions that create in-sample and out-of-sample
forecasts from given parameters (e.g. exchange rate, oil price, volatility
measure, frequency, sample period, and ratio of out-of-sample forecasts to
in-sample window size. Results are written to the "Results" sub-folder.

'evaluation.R': contains functions that produce evaluations from results
generated by 'forecast.R'. The first function ('evaluate') calculates success
ratio (SR) and performs directional accuracy (DA), Diebold-Mariano (DM), and
Clark-West (CW) tests. Results are then written to the "Results" sub-folder. 
The second function ('print_MCS') yields the results of the MCS test for MAE
and MSE loss functions.

'UIP.R': contains functions that produce in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts
from given parameters (as in 'forecast.R') for the uncovered interest rate
parity (UIRP) model. Results are written to the "Results" sub-folder.

'graph.R': contains code for creating the graphs appearing in Breen Hu 2021.
Graphs are written to PNG files in the "Graphs" sub-folder.

'Data/': contains daily and monthly frequency data for exchange rates, OVX, and
oil prices, as well as files containing interest rates at daily and monthly
frequency for use in UIRP forecasts.

'Graphs/': graphs created by 'graph.R' are written here.

'Results/': forecast results created by 'forecast.R' and forecast evaluations
created by 'evaluation.R' are written here.
